## Quickstart

Install the latest Cookiecutter if you haven't installed it yet (this requires
Cookiecutter 1.4.0 or higher):

```

Generate a Python package project::

Then:

* Initialize a local Git repository.
* Create a new, **empty** repository, for example on GitHub.
* Push the newly created project there.

After a couple of minutes, open the repository settings on GitHub:

1. go to the "Pages" section
2. under "Source" select "gh-pages" and save.


## Fork This / Create Your Own

If you have differences in your preferred setup, I encourage you to fork this
to create your own version. Or create your own; it doesn't strictly have to
be a fork.

* Once you have your own version working, add it to the Similar Cookiecutter
  Templates list above with a brief description.

* It's up to you whether or not to rename your fork/own version. Do whatever
  you think sounds good.
